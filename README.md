#EasyEnroll  Software

We created a software that is designed for AUC students to help them with advising and registration plans. Students can generate an automated plan, generate a plan with there preferences, create a plan manually, generate a schedule for the upcoming semester, create a matual plan with a friend, and see details of courses using a drop-down box.

## How to Run

1. start xampp
2. ⁠npm start backend-login
3. npm start backend-mutual
4. npm run dev automated
5. node server.js main/src
6. npm start main

Ports:
8081: backend login
1900: mutual plan backend
5174: automated plan
5000: main server.js
3000: main frontend

## Integrated APIS
We used Xampp to connect to a phpMyAdmin for the databases. We also used OpenAI for the generation of plans and the schedule.
